## PBS SCRIPT GENERATION SETUP
##############################

# Number of nodes per job
numNodes: 1

# Number of processors per job (eg: 1-8)
processors: 8

# Processor memory in MB
pmem: 1000

# Cluster queue (eg: default, debug, scavenge, astro)
queue: default 

# Maximum time in hh:mm:ss that each job will run on the cluster (eg: 08:00:00)
walltime: '12:00:00'

# Cluster user name 
username: gardnerj

# Root email address for notifications about cluster jobs (eg: @email_address)
rootEmail: '@phys.washington.edu'

# Job name (eg: username on the cluster)
jobname: JeffsImSim

# Name of the tarball of the 'data' directory.
tarball: data.tar.gz

## DIRECTORY & PATH SETUP
#########################

# Relative path to directory that has the SEDS, QE, and height maps
# On UW cluster this directory is data/
datadir: data

# Name of temporary directory on node to store images.
# This directory will be created in the scratchpartition/nodedir directory.
nodeDatadir: simData

# Absolute path to the directory where the final images/logs are to be written
savedir: '/share/lsstpoly/gardnerj/'

# Absolute path to the staging directory for transfers (can be the same as savedir)
transferPath: '/share/lsstpoly/gardnerj/'

# Scratch partition on compute nodes where jobs will be run
scratchpartition: '/state/partition1'

# Tempoprary landing path for all files created for each imsim run (eg. parameter, fits files)
imsimRunDir: parFilesTemp

## The following two policies are now environment variables. Use:
#setenv IMSIM_HOME_DIR /share/home/nms/pt1.2imsimTrunk/
#setenv CAT_SHARE_DATA /share/pogo3/krughoff/shared/

## Absolute path to the directory location of the simulator version you wish to run
#imsimHomePath: '/share/home/nms/pt1.2imsimTrunk'

## Absolute path to the main imsim 'data' storage (SEDS, data tarball, etc.)
## On UW Cluster this is /share/pogo3/krughoff/shared/
#imsimDataPath: '/share/pogo3/krughoff/shared/'

## JOB MONITOR DATABASE SETUP
#############################

# Use the jobAllocator database (yes=1 or no=2)
useDatabase: 2 

# JobAllocator database table number (50-100)
tableId: 75

# sims/catalogs/generation location
catGen: /share/home/nms/catalogs_generation 
 
## SUBMIT (QSUB) SCRIPT SETUP
#############################

# Time in seconds for script to sleep between queue queries
sleep: 300

# Time in seconds to wait between successive job submissions to the cluster
wait: 2

# Maximum number of jobs allowed to be queued (running + idle) on the cluster
maxJobs: 10
